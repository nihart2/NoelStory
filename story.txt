There once was a man named John and he was really into scuba diving. One day, while on an excursion in lake mendota he saw something shimmering at the bottom of the cold, murky depths. He went down to observe what it was and, just as he approached it, he realized that it was the sunken wreck of a submarine!
As he swam toward the submarine, he realized that this submarine was incredibly old. Out of curiousity, John swam into the submarine and tried to open one of the doors, only to find it was locked. But that didn't stop John. He tried opening another door, found that it opened, and swam into this submarine.
Inside the submarine John discovered a stash of five guys double bacon cheese burgers. Five guys had been John's favorite food since he was a young lad, and he couldn't bare to see the burgers sit there and get soggy. He didn't have the raw strength to take them all with him, so John began to consume the burgers one by one.
He soon became very ill after eating all of the soggy burgers. He needed to get to safety so he hastily swam to the surface and ran to Mooyah, the superior fast food burger joint on State street, and ate a burger there. It cured his sickness. He was now ready to return to his scuba expedition.
