There once was a man named John and he was really into scuba diving. One day, while on an excursion in lake mendota he saw something shimmering at the bottom of the cold, murky depths. He went down to observe what it was and, just as he approached it, he realized that it was the sunken wreck of a submarine!
As he swam toward the submarine, he realized that this submarine was incredibly old. Out of curiousity, John swam into the submarine and tried to open one of the doors, only to find it was locked. But that didn't stop John. He tried opening another door, found that it opened, and swam into this submarine.
